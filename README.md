# emojions

Attempting to produce emojis from your own facial expressions :)

## Setup

TODO i'll try and set up a dependencies .yaml so that its easy to set up

Probably only works properly on Mac since that's the keyboard hotkey I'm using, and the 'apple color
emoji' font package might not work on other machines? who knows!

- Install OpenCV and opencv-contrib-python
